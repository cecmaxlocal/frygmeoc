Drizzle is an open-source relational database management system (DBMS) that was forked from the MySQL 6.0 development branch. It was designed with a microkernel architecture to improve modularity and performance. Key aspects of its license include:

- Drizzle is licensed under version 2 and 3 of the GNU General Public License (GPL), which is a copyleft license requiring that derived works also be open source under the GPL.
- Portions of Drizzle, including the libdrizzle client library, are under the BSD license, which is permissive and allows more freedom in usage and distribution without copyleft obligations.
- As an open-source project, Drizzle's source code and documentation have historically been freely available, with contributions from multiple organizations including Canonical, Google, and Red Hat.
- The project officially ended active development around 2016 but the code remains accessible under these licenses.

Therefore, Drizzleâ€™s licensing model predominantly revolves around GPL for the core server, ensuring freedom and openness while encouraging community contributions, with BSD licensing for select libraries offering more permissive usage.

For users, this means Drizzle can be freely used, modified, and distributed within the terms of these licenses; GPL requires disclosure of source when distributing modified versions whereas BSD permits proprietary use without disclosure.

This hybrid licensing approach balanced Drizzle's goals of open collaboration and commercial applicability in the database ecosystem.[1][5]
