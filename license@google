Google's software licenses encompass a variety of types depending on the product and its intended use. Common license categories Google uses include:

- Free licenses, which allow usage without cost, typically with some feature or usage limitations.
- On-demand or Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) licenses, common in Google Cloud services, where users are billed for actual usage.
- Bring Your Own License (BYOL) or Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS), allowing customers to use licenses they already possess outside of Google.
- Individual licenses assigned to a single user or device.
- OEM licenses bundled with hardware.
- Named user licenses assigned to specific users.
- Volume licenses allowing multiple users or installations.
- Trial or evaluation licenses to test software before purchase.
- Enterprise licenses (perpetual or subscription) used by companies for broader deployment.
- Open source licenses for certain Google-developed projects, often permissive or copyleft licenses like Apache 2.0 or GPL variants.

For example, Google Workspace licenses grant access to integrated services like Gmail, Drive, and Calendar for authorized users. Google Cloud platform products typically use subscription or PAYG models. Licensing terms dictate usage rights, restrictions, renewal, and other contractual elements.

Google also manages licensing through license keys, user accounts, or subscription tokens to control and track usage. The exact license type and terms vary across products, cloud services, APIs, and open source components.

In summary, Google licenses range widely from free and open source to commercial subscription and enterprise licenses, designed to accommodate individual users, developers, businesses, and cloud customers with flexible usage models and conditions.[1][2][3][4]
