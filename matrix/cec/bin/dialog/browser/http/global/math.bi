'' Here is an example of a `pattern.bi` header file for FreeBASIC 
'' designed to support AI-driven results with a focus on plotting 
'' and graphics. This file declares basic types, constants, and 
'' function prototypes that support artificial intelligence 
'' computations, plotting, and graphic rendering:

'' ```freebasic
#ifndef __PATTERN_BI__
#define __PATTERN_BI__

'' Constants used in AI results and graphics
Const MAX_DATA_POINTS As Integer = 1000
Const GRAPH_WIDTH As Integer = 640
Const GRAPH_HEIGHT As Integer = 480

'' Structure to hold AI result data point
Type AIResult
    inputValue As Double
    predictedValue As Double
End Type

'' Array to hold results
Dim Shared Results(MAX_DATA_POINTS) As AIResult
Dim Shared ResultCount As Integer

'' Function prototypes for AI result computation and plotting
Declare Sub ComputeAIResults(inputs() As Double, count As Integer)
Declare Sub PlotAIResults()

'' Utility function to clear results
Declare Sub ClearResults()

#EndIf
'' ```

'' Explanation:
'' - `AIResult` represents individual data points with an input and a predicted output from AI computation.
'' - `Results` array stores multiple AI results up to a limit for plotting or analysis.
'' - `ComputeAIResults` would be implemented to perform AI prediction logic on input data.
'' - `PlotAIResults` would render results as a graphic plot (e.g., line graph).
'' - `ClearResults` resets data for a new session.

'' This header file organizes the core interface for AI data processing and plotting 
'' in a modular way for FreeBASIC. Implementations of these function and sub declarations 
'' would be in your `.bas` source files, using graphics libraries or native commands 
'' to create corresponding visualizations.

'' Including this file via `#include once "pattern.bi"` allows your FreeBASIC programs 
'' to modularly add AI-driven pattern recognition with clear plotting capabilities.

'' If you want, I can provide example `.bas` implementations to complement this header 
'' with real AI computation and graphical plotting code.

'' This design approach leverages FreeBASICâ€™s header (`.bi`) system to cleanly separate 
'' interface declarations for AI and graphical plotting modules.[1]
