'' In FreeBASIC, a `.bi` file is typically a header file used 
'' to declare constants, types, variables, and function prototypes 
'' that can be included into your main program source `.bas` files.

'' To create a header file named `fbscript.bi` that could represent 
'' concepts related to HTTP, filenames, databases, and network connections, 
'' you might want to define constants, declare connection-related variables, 
'' and organize reusable declarations.

'' Here is an example content for `fbscript.bi` you can create with 
'' any text editor:

'' ```freebasic
'' fbscript.bi - header file for HTTP, filename, database, network declarations

'' Constants for HTTP status codes
Const HTTP_OK As Integer = 200
Const HTTP_NOT_FOUND As Integer = 404
Const HTTP_INTERNAL_ERROR As Integer = 500

'' Max filename length
Const MAX_FILENAME_LEN As Integer = 260

'' Declare filename buffer
Dim Shared Filename As ZString * MAX_FILENAME_LEN

'' Database connection structure
Type DBConnection
    Host As ZString * 100
    Port As Integer
    User As ZString * 50
    Password As ZString * 50
    DatabaseName As ZString * 100
    Connected As Integer ' 0 = false, 1 = true
End Type

'' Declare a global database connection variable
Dim Shared DbConn As DBConnection

'' Network connection related declarations
Const DEFAULT_HTTP_PORT As Integer = 80
Const DEFAULT_HTTPS_PORT As Integer = 443

'' Procedure prototypes for network and database operations
Declare Function ConnectToDatabase(conn As DBConnection) As Integer
Declare Sub DisconnectDatabase(conn As DBConnection)

Declare Function SendHttpRequest(url As ZString) As Integer
Declare Function ReceiveHttpResponse() As String

'' Example stub implementations (should be defined in .bas for real functionality)
'' Function ConnectToDatabase(conn As Ptr DBConnection) As Integer
''     ' Implementation goes here
'' End Function

'' Sub DisconnectDatabase(conn As Ptr DBConnection)
''     ' Implementation goes here
'' End Sub
'' ```

'' To use this header file in your main FreeBASIC program, include it at the top:

'' ```freebasic
'' #include once "fbscript.bi"

'' ' Now you can use the declarations like DbConn, ConnectToDatabase and others
'' ```

'' This approach allows separation of reusable declarations (network, database, filename handling) into `fbscript.bi`. The actual implementations of declared functions should be in your `.bas` source files.

'' Creating and organizing code in this way aids modular and maintainable FreeBASIC projects involving HTTP, file handling, and database/network connectivity concepts.

'' Let me know if you want sample `.bas` implementation for these prototypes or further guidance on network/database coding in FreeBASIC.[1][2]
