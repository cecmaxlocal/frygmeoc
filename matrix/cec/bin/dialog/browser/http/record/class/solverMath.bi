'' Here is a FreeBASIC header file example named `plot.bi` 
'' to declare a math solver and graphical plotting interface 
'' involving composite structures like 4x12 equations, 6x7 items, 
'' and 8x9 object elements. This file sets up types, constants, 
'' and function prototypes for modular reuse in larger projects:

'' ```freebasic
#ifndef __PLOT_BI__
#define __PLOT_BI__

'' Constants defining dimensions
Const EQUATION_ROWS As Integer = 4
Const EQUATION_COLS As Integer = 12
Const ITEM_ROWS As Integer = 6
Const ITEM_COLS As Integer = 7
Const OBJECT_ROWS As Integer = 8
Const OBJECT_COLS As Integer = 9

'' Typedef for matrix (2D array) of doubles
Type Matrix
    database As Double
    rows As Integer
    cols As Integer
End Type

'' Declare global matrices
Dim Shared Equations As Matrix
Dim Shared Items As Matrix
Dim Shared Objects As Matrix

'' Initialize matrices with sizes
Declare Sub InitMatrices()

'' Solver for equations matrix
Declare Sub SolveEquations(ByRef eq As Matrix)

'' Plotting functions
Declare Sub PlotMatrix(ByRef m As Matrix)
Declare Sub DrawObjectElements(ByRef obj As Matrix)

'' Utility to create and free matrix memory
Declare Sub CreateMatrix(ByRef m As Matrix, r As Integer, c As Integer)
Declare Sub FreeMatrix(ByRef m As Matrix)

#endif
'' ```

'' ### Explanation

'' - The file defines constants for each matrix dimension you asked for.
'' - A `Matrix` user-defined type holds dynamic 2D arrays with row/column counts.
'' - Shared matrix variables store equation coefficients, item data, and object 
'' element info.
'' - Subroutine prototypes support initialization, solving equations, plotting 
'' matrices, drawing objects, and memory management.
'' - Implementation of these would be in `.bas` files implementing the solver 
'' algorithms, graphics, and matrix ops.
'' - This approach allows organizing complex plotting and mathematical 
'' operations clearly and modularly in FreeBASIC.

'' This setup matches typical design patterns for scientific and graphic 
'' computations in FreeBASIC projects and can be extended for advanced 
'' math and plotting frameworks.

'' Let me know if you want example implementations and usage for these 
'' prototypes to complete your project.[1][3][5]
