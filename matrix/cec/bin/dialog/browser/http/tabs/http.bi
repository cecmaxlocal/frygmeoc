'' To create a tab-delimited file named `tabs.bi` 
'' in FreeBASIC with a creative table and save it, 
'' here is a simple example:

'' ```freebasic
'' Create a tab-delimited file tabs.bi with example data table

Dim As Integer fileNumBuffer = FreeFile()
Open "tabs.bi" For Output As #fileNumBuffer

' Print header row with tab delimiter
Print #fileNumBuffer, "Name" + Chr(9) + "Age" + Chr(9) + "City"

' Print some example rows with tab delimiter
Print #fileNumBuffer, "Alice" + Chr(9) + "29" + Chr(9) + "New York"
Print #fileNumBuffer, "Bob" + Chr(9) + "35" + Chr(9) + "Los Angeles"
Print #fileNumBuffer, "Charlie" + Chr(9) + "22" + Chr(9) + "Chicago"

Close #fileNumBuffer
' ```

' Explanation:
' - `Chr(9)` outputs a tab character to separate columns.
' - The file `tabs.bi` will be created in the current directory.
' - The contents represent a simple table with columns "Name", "Age", and "City".
' - This tab-delimited format can be opened in spreadsheet programs or processed as a structured text table.

' This approach allows you to create any table-like data using tabs for column separation in FreeBASIC easily. You can customize the columns and rows as needed. This basic method is useful for exporting data that can be interpreted as a table by external programs or scripts.

' For linking this to an HTTP endpoint (e.g., posting or downloading via HTTP), you would need additional libraries or calls for network interaction, which is outside standard FreeBASIC text file output but can be implemented with external APIs or tools if desired.[1][4]

' Let me know if you want code examples for integrating HTTP operations too.
