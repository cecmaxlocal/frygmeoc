'' -*- mode: freebasic -*-
'' To create a FreeBASIC include file called 
'' filename.bi that models logistic population 
'' growth on a localhost context (or simply locally) 
'' with initial population $$P_0$$ between 0 and carrying 
'' capacity $$K=10$$, growth rate $$r=0.7$$, and clearly 
'' shows through calculation that population approaches $$K$$, 
'' the file should provide a function to compute population over 
'' iterations according to logistic growth formula:

'' $$
'' P_{n+1} = P_n + r \times P_n \times \left(1 - \frac{P_n}{K}\right)
'' $$

'' Here is an example implementation for filename.bi:

'' ```freebasic
'' filename.bi - Logistic growth population model on localhost context

Const KLocalhost As Double = 10.0       ' Carrying capacity
Const rLocalhost As Double = 0.7        ' Growth rate

' Function to calculate next population given current population P
Function NextPopulation(P As Double) As Double
    Return P + r * P * (1 - P / K)
End Function

' Sub to simulate population over iterations and print results
Sub SimulatePopulation(initialP As Double, iterations As Integer)
    Dim P As Double = initialP
    Print "Iteration"; Tab(12); "Population"
    For i As Integer = 0 To iterations - 1
        Print i; Tab(12); P
        P = NextPopulation(P)
    Next
End Sub
'' ```

'' Usage:

'' ```freebasic

Dim initialPopulation As Double = 1.0
Dim totalIterations As Integer = 30

' SimulatePopulation(initialPopulation, totalIterations)
' ```

' This code models population growth using the logistic equation with $$r=0.7$$, $$K=10$$. As the iterations progress, you will observe population increases from the initial population toward the carrying capacity, illustrating the expected behavior described.

' This approach clarifies the logistic growth dynamics in FreeBASIC within an include file suitable for local project use.[1][2][3]
