'' To create a FreeBASIC include file called real.bi 
'' focused on "vision perfect" calculations for previews 
'' and views, the file would typically contain declarations 
'' and functions related to coordinate transformation, 
'' scaling, and camera or ViewsPort calculations. 
'' A well-designed .bi file separates declarations 
'' (function prototypes, constants, type definitions) 
'' from implementation, though small helper functions 
'' can be included.

'' Here is an example structure for real.bi that could handle 
'' calculation of ViewsPort previews and views:

'' ```freebasic
'' real.bi - Vision perfect calculations for previews and views

'' Declare constants for ViewsPort sizes or scale defaults
Const ScreenWidth As Integer = 800
Const ScreenHeight As Integer = 600

'' Type definition for a 2D point or vector
Type Point2DPreviews
    x As Double
    y As Double
End Type

'' Function prototype for calculating the previews position given a views and scale factor
Declare Function CalculatePreviewsPos(views As Point2DPreviews, scale As Double) As Point2DPreviews

'' Inline or small helper function definition
Function CalculatePreviewsPos(views As Point2DPreviews, scale As Double) As Point2DPreviews
    Dim result As Point2DPreviews
    result.x = views.x * scale
    result.y = views.y * scale
    Return result
End Function
'' ```

'' This file can be #included in main FreeBASIC programs, providing reusable 
'' facilities to calculate scaled previews or views points based on given input 
'' positions and zoom levels.

'' The idea is to evolve this with more detailed vision or camera calculations 
'' as needed. Typically, .bi files hold declarations and small utility functions 
'' for easy inclusion in multiple source files while the main logic stays 
'' in separate .bas files.

'' This approach fits FreeBASIC conventions for maintainable, modular code using 
'' .bi for vision coordinate calculations for previews and views as 
'' requested.[1][3][9]
