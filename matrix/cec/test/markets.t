# Example test: check if a market data file exists
my $filename = "market_data.txt";

ok(-e $filename, "Checking if $filename exists");
# ```

# You run this script by executing:
# ```bash
# perl markets.t
# ```
# Based on the web sources, a `.t` file in Perl 
# is simply a Perl script used for testing, and 
# it typically resides within a `t/` directory. 
# These files are executed using the `perl` command 
# or testing tools like `prove`. They contain test 
# code usually written with modules such as 
# `Test::Simple`, which provides functions like 
# `ok()`, for asserting conditions during tests. 

# To create an appropriate `markets.t` script for 
# your purpose in Perl, you can structure 
# it as follows:

# ```perl

# or with `prove`:
# ```bash
# prove -v markets.t
# # ```

# This approach helps organize tests cleanly and run them systematically, reflecting industry-standard practices discussed in community resources. The name and placement in the `t/` directory follow typical Perl testing conventions.[3][4][6]
