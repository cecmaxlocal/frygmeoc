# README.md for ./frygmeoc Project

## Overview
The ./frygmeoc project is a FreeBASIC-based solution providing IDE extensions, packages, and installation support focusing on Markets, Galileo(s), Galileans, and Municipalities. This project is modular, leveraging FreeBASIC's extensibility to facilitate development workflows tailored for municipal license and market management systems with Galileo-inspired methodologies.



## Features

- **FreeBASIC IDE Extensions**: Custom extensions to enhance FreeBASIC development, including dialog handling, file management, and scripting utilities.
- **Package Management**: Support for modular packages to simplify code reuse and distribution across projects focused on municipal and market applications.
- **Installation Guide**: Clear instructions to setup the FreeBASIC environment and the project’s components on Windows and Linux systems.
- **Municipal & Market Modules**: Specific libraries and scripts to manage licensing, renewals, and data handling for municipal governance and market analytics.
- **Galileo & Galilean Inspired Components**: Algorithms and utilities inspired by Galileo’s scientific approaches adapted for software models in data processing and simulation.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:  
   Ensure FreeBASIC compiler and IDE are installed. Download from [FreeBASIC Official Site](https://freebasic.net).  
2. **Project Setup**:  
   Clone or download the ./frygmeoc repository.  
3. **Directory Structure**:  
   - `./extensions`: IDE enhancements in FreeBASIC  
   - `./packages`: Reusable code packages for applications  
   - `./municipals`: Municipal license & permit processing modules  
   - `./markets`: Market data processing libraries  
4. **Build & Run**:  
   Use FreeBASIC compiler to build source files. Example:  
   ```
   fbc ./municipals/license_manager.bas
   ./license_manager.exe
   ```
5. **Configuration**:  
   Update paths and settings in `config.bi` for local system specifics and database connections.
